Hive stuff:
typeAdapters... used to connect classes with hive.  it needs to have build_runner, and hive_flutter.

hive has to be initialized with 
Hive.init(path as string)  (path different on ios and android... and doesn't exist for web)

Hive uses boxes... they have to be opened first.  When opened, the box is put into memory.

Hive.openBox('boxName');

1. use hive generator package.
2. import Hive.
3. @HiveType()
4. @HiveField(0)....1...2..3, etc. for each field.
5. add     part 'Contact.g.dart';   to class and run =>  flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
6. register it: Hive.registerAdapter(CLASSAdapter(), TypeID)  (0, 1, 2....)

it seems like, when things are weird, that running 'flutter clean' followed by flutter pub get and then the build_runner thing above works?
